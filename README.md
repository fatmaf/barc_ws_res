# BARC Robotics Workshop - Nov 2017

## Setting Up 

We recommend ROS and Ubuntu. ROS does have not so great support for other operating systems too. You can take a look here: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation

In case you do not have Ubuntu or ROS installed. 

If you do not have Ubuntu and don't want to install it. You can get a virtual machine (vm) image. 
### Virtual Machine 
* Download virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* Grab the image for ubuntu with ROS indigo here: https://nootrix.com/diy-tutos/ros-indigo-virtual-machine/

**This is not the latest version. If you'd like a newer version, you may have to install the machine yourself. 
You can grab an image here http://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/ **

### Installing Ubuntu 
Instructions here : https://builtvisible.com/the-ubuntu-installation-guide/
You can download 14.04 or 16.04. We reccommend the latest. 
__With Ubuntu 14.04 you will need to install ROS Indigo__
__With Ubuntu 16.04 you will need to install ROS Kinetic__
